	abstract = {Total Station has been one of the most common acquisition devices for achieving maps through topographic survey. Nowadays, Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) and Photogrammetry are commonly used to generate accurate meshes. In addition, commercial products such as Kinect offer low cost technology to acquire point-cloud information. The present paper aims to measure the accuracy of these digital modelling techniques by employing elevation contour maps, surface deviations and distance measurements. For this purpose, a 450 m sector of the Qhapaq Nan located in Lima-Peru, was selected as a case of study. A camera-enabled drone was used for acquiring pictures to obtain a high-resolution photogrammetric model. Subsequently, a 3D survey of the monument was conducted with a time-of-flight laser scanner. Contour elevation lines where extracted from TLS, Photogrammetry and Total Station models at the same depths in order to determine the precision of photogrammetry and laser scanner reconstructions. In addition, geometrical comparisons were performed among the 3D models above mentioned and the Kinect sensor. The comparison showed that TLS is the most accurate tool for 3D reconstruction. However, Photogrammetry and Kinect provided errors of less than one centimeter in accuracy.},

The AC power meter, provided as open hardware, is designed using the same micro controller as the Arduino UNO 1 with an In-system Programming (ISP) interface, thus allowing the user to change the firmware to match their particular use case using Arduino libraries or standard C language. The suggested design is compatible with the Raspberry Pi 3 2 , making it a suitable real-time measurement accessory for the single board computer. The platform features an 8 channel simultaneous sampling Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) which allows a high fidelity sampling without time offsets. Depend-ing on how the user decides to combine current transformers (CTs) and AC-AC voltage adapters for the input channels, circuit breakers or appliances can be measured in either one phase or three phases.},

This framework enables building occupants and visitors to learn about the well and green features of the new NZEB while facilitating collection of environmental comfort feedback in a simple and intuitive way. Within just three months, 1163 feedback responses of thermal, visual and aural comfort were obtained. A total of 616 participants have contributed to the study till date, with 79 participants who provided five or more instances of feedback. This data set provides new opportunities for understanding occupant comfort behavior through supervised and unsupervised data-driven methods. This paper demonstrates how occupants can be clustered into comfort personality types that could be used as a foundation for prediction and recommendation systems that use real-time occupant behavior instead of rigid comfort models. We provide an overview of the application methodology and initial results in the SDE4 building.},

Unlike other camera-based solutions, FORK is much less privacy invasive (even if the sensor is compromised) and it does not require a powerful machine like a Microsoft XBOX or an Intel ® Core TM i7 processor to process the depth data. Our system performs the entire depth data processing on a cheaper and lower-power ARM processor, in real-time. In order to do that, FORK uses a novel light-weight human model by leveraging anthropometric properties of human bodies for detecting individuals. We will show how FORK detects, tracks, and counts occupants accurately in real-time.},

	abstract = {Thermal comfort assessment for the built environment has become more available to analysts and researchers due to the proliferation of sensors and subjective feedback methods. These data can be used for modeling comfort behavior to support design and operations towards energy efficiency and well-being. By nature, occupant subjective feedback is imbalanced as indoor conditions are designed for comfort, and responses indicating otherwise are less common. This situation creates a scenario for the machine learning workflow where class balancing as a pre-processing step might be valuable for developing predictive thermal comfort classification models with high-performance. This paper investigates the various thermal comfort dataset class balancing techniques from the literature and proposes a modified conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), \${\textbackslash}texttt\{comfortGAN\}\$, to address this imbalance scenario. These approaches are applied to three publicly available datasets, ranging from 30 and 67 participants to a global collection of thermal comfort datasets, with 1,474; 2,067; and 66,397 data points, respectively. This work finds that a classification model trained on a balanced dataset, comprised of real and generated samples from \${\textbackslash}texttt\{comfortGAN\}\$, has higher performance (increase between 4\% and 17\% in classification accuracy) than other augmentation methods tested. However, when classes representing discomfort are merged and reduced to three, better imbalanced performance is expected, and the additional increase in performance by \${\textbackslash}texttt\{comfortGAN\}\$ shrinks to 1-2\%. These results illustrate that class balancing for thermal comfort modeling is beneficial using advanced techniques such as GANs, but its value is diminished in certain scenarios. A discussion is provided to assist potential users in determining which scenarios this process is useful and which method works best.},

The individuals were grouped based on their thermal preference responses and had their transition times analyzed. Each group has various transition time from arriving at and leaving from their comfort state. On average people who are more sensitive to cold temperatures, Group 1, take 8.9 minutes from being uncomfortably cold and 25.0 minutes from being uncomfortably hot to reach comfort zones. On the other hand, people who are generally comfortable, Group 2, take 22.4 minutes from uncomfortably cold and 27.1 minutes from uncomfortably hot to be thermally comfortable. The average transition time within a cluster matches the thermal comfort trend of said cluster. Ultimately, the transient time of preference groups raises the possibility to improve individualized thermal comfort models and machine learning in the future.},

Moreover, they provide a more realistic scenario to those conducted in thermal chambers. Our objective was to share publicly a longitudinal dataset comprising data collected over a 4-week long experiment. A total of 17 participants completed thermal preferences surveys which accounted for a total of approximately 1400 unique responses across indoor and outdoor 17 spaces. For the whole duration of the study, we monitored environmental variables (e.g., temperature and relative humidity) throughout 3 buildings. Participants completed comfort surveys from the screen of their smartwatches using an open-source application named Cozie. Their indoor location was continuously monitored using a custom-designed smartphone application. Location data were used to time and spatially align environmental measurements to thermal preference responses provided by the participants. Background information of participants, such as physical characteristics and personality traits (satisfaction with life scale, highly sensitive person scale, the Big Five personality traits), was collected using an on-boarding survey administered at the beginning of the experiment.

Existing approaches make use of pre-defined rules with pre-defined set-points, i.e., the temperature set-points in an indoor environment, which in turn contributes to one third of the total energy consumption of buildings. Research has explored advanced modelling and sensing techniques for prediction models in order to define better temperature set-points but such prediction remains a fundamental challenge due to the individual preferences of occupants. In this current work I systematically explored data requirements for thermal preference modeling and prediction by generating synthethic data and by leveraging occupants similarities. The results show that augmenting existing datasets provides around 4\% improvements in prediction models and grouping users based on pre-calculated similarities allows an average increase of 5\% for half the occupants in prediction with less historical data (or sometimes none). As next steps, my research aims at combining these new modeling approaches with occupant-centric control for a complete human-in-the-loop control framework.},

	abstract = {Global climate is changing as a result of anthropogenic warming, leading to higher daily excursions of temperature in cities. Such elevated temperatures have great implications on human thermal comfort and heat stress, which should be closely monitored. Current methods for heat exposure assessments (surveys, microclimate measurements, and laboratory experiments), however, present several limitations: measurements are scattered in time and space and data gathered on outdoor thermal stress and comfort often does not include physiological and behavioral parameters. To address these shortcomings, Project Coolbit aims to introduce a human-centric approach to thermal comfort assessments. In this study, we propose and evaluate the use of wrist-mounted wearable devices to monitor environmental and physiological responses that span a wide range of spatial and temporal distributions. We introduce an integrated wearable weather station that records (a) microclimate parameters (such as air temperature and humidity), (b) physiological parameters (heart rate, skin temperature and humidity), and (c) subjective feedback. The feasibility of this methodology to assess thermal comfort and heat stress is then evaluated using two sets of experiments: controlled-environment physiological data collection, and outdoor environmental data collection. We find that using the data obtained through the wrist-mounted wearables, core temperature can be predicted non-invasively with 95 percent of target attainment within ±0.27 ◦C. Additionally, a direct connection between the air temperature at the wrist (Ta,w) and the perceived activity level (PAV) of individuals was drawn. We observe that with increased Ta,w, the desire for physical activity is significantly reduced, reaching ‘Transition only’ PAV level at 36 ◦C. These assessments reveal that the wearable methodology provides a comprehensive and accurate representation of human heat exposure, which can be extended in real-time to cover a large spatial distribution in a given city and quantify the impact of heat exposure on human life.},

Unfortunately, real-world applications are still restricted by the high implementation cost and the unguaranteed profitability. In the traditional paradigm of “model-centric” MPC, most effort is devoted to constructing the control-oriented model given specific building properties and data availability. Due to the significant heterogeneity among buildings, the results are hardly reproducible, and a high level of customization is required for each new building. To address this issue, we propose a new “data-centric” approach for MPC, which starts with control-oriented data curation that acquires the necessary and cost-effective data concerning the intended control purpose and the building characteristics. The foundation of data-centric MPC is a standardized framework to quantify the data requirements and the established relationships between data usage and control performance. Such an end-to-end framework promotes actual MPC applications with controllable costs and reliable outcomes. We use tropical office buildings as an example to consolidate the data-centric MPC framework. Two use cases are provided to demonstrate its benefits. Over 10\% of energy saving was achieved without excessive occupant-related data, and occupant-centric control significantly improved the thermal comfort only with proper data acquisition.},

	abstract = {The intersection of buildings control and thermal comfort modeling may seem obvious, but there are still prevalent challenges in combining them. “Occupant centric” control strategies are mainly trained using building data but rarely leverage occupants’ feedback. While thermal comfort models are developed using occupants’ data but are seldom integrated into building controls. To bridge this gap, we developed an open-source simulation tool named ComfortLearn. ComfortLearn is an OpenAI Gym-based environment that leverages historical building management system data from real buildings and existing longitudinal thermal comfort datasets for occupant-centric control strategies and benchmarking. We used an evaluation metric named ‘exceedance’ to evaluate occupants’ thermal comfort and provide a more realistic picture than traditional evaluations like comfort bands. This setup allows the analysis of different building control strategies and their effect on real occupants, based on empirical data, without the need for computationally expensive co-simulations. A theoretical case study implementation shows that an as-is schedule-based controller complies with its comfort band more than 93\% of the time, but the simulated occupants are comfortable for only 25\% of the occupied time.},

	abstract = {Building occupants are complex in the aspects of the indoor environment that satisfies them. Thermal comfort-driven systems control, office floor plan design, and lighting or acoustics considerations are all driven by conventional understandings of how occupants use spaces. Building operators rely on the use of smart system control, however, these approaches ignore the ability of occupants to make decisions for themselves that influence their comfort, satisfaction, and productivity. The future-of-work paradigm shift will introduce more flexibility and behavior-driven opportunities for occupants. The emerging just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) concept is gaining momentum in fields such as mobile health as a means of influencing behavior. This paper outlines a novel methodology using smartwatch-based JITAI combined with micro-ecological momentary assessments (EMA) for field-based data collection and occupant behavior interventions in field-based scenarios. A proof-of-concept deployment of a single user of the methodology is illustrated in order to set the stage for future data collection. This framework can provide the foundation for techniques to enhance the future-ofwork through behavioral interventions in the built environment.},

abstract = {{In the energy domain, the classification of power meters has become an increasingly significant area of interest, such as appliance identification and characteristics prediction, enabling targeted and efficient energy management. However, the limited availability of labeled data for power meters and the inconsistencies in labeling and naming conventions have constrained the potential of metadata for further application. This study aims to bridge the gap by employing semi-supervised Generative Adversarial Networks (SGAN) to classify 1805 power meters distributed globally. This approach explores and assesses the advantages of incorporating unlabeled power meter data into the learning process. A comparative analysis is performed between supervised and semi-supervised baseline models using different proportions of labeled data. The results reveal that SGAN can achieve an accuracy rate exceeding 0.8 with just 100 labeled samples, whereas a Two-dimensional Convolution Neural Network (2D-CNN) requires a minimum of 300 samples to attain the same performance level. The innovative contribution of this study lies in formulating a refined classification model and a label propagation method that optimizes the use of unlabeled energy meter data. Additionally, the classification framework established in this study has the potential for expanded application in categorizing other metadata.}},

abstract = {{The widespread availability of open datasets in urban areas is transforming how urban energy systems are planned, simulated, and visualized. Urban energy models, however, require an understanding of urban dwellers, as their activities create the demands for energy in buildings. In this paper, we explore using campus-scale Wi-Fi data to identify typical occupant activity patterns as an input to an agent-based model of building occupants at the district scale. The data is taken from a Singaporean university’s Wi-Fi network at high resolution. Each record comprises a timestamp, a device identifier, the location of the device within the campus, and the access point to which it is connected. The Wi-Fi dataset contains 120 different buildings on campus and 10,300 anonymized individual devices. Activities are then assigned to each location on campus according to the building use type. In order to test the methodology, the activity plans of 27,604 undergraduate students, 8,304 graduate students, and 12,018 employees were simulated over a workweek. The results show the model’s ability to produce plausible activity plans but could be improved by implementing sampling rules and expanding the source dataset to include off-peak dates. Nevertheless, using such an agent-based modeling approach at the district scale appears to be a promising methodology to assess the impacts of different planning strategies on occupant behavior and district energy demand.}},

Although several efforts have been made to consolidate existing open datasets, no database currently offers a comprehensive collection of building data types with all subcategories and time granularities (e.g., year, month, and sub-hour). This paper presents the Building Data Genome Directory, an open data-sharing platform serving as a one-stop shop for the data necessary for vital categories of building energy research. The data directory is an online portal (buildingdatadirectory.org/) that allows filtering and discovering valuable datasets. The directory covers meter, building-level, and aggregated community-level data at the spatial scale and year-to-minute level at the temporal scale. The datasets were consolidated from a comprehensive exploration of sources, including governments, research institutes, and online energy dashboards. The results of this effort include the aggregation of 60 datasets pertaining to building energy ontologies, building energy models, building energy and water data, electric vehicle data, weather data, building information data, text-mining-based research data, image data of buildings, fault detection diagnosis data and occupant data. A crowdsourcing mechanism in the platform allows users to submit datasets they suggest for inclusion by filling out an online form. This directory can fuel research and applications on building energy efficiency, which is an essential step toward addressing the world’s energy and environmental challenges.}},

This raises two considerations: newly unoccupied spaces needlessly consume energy, and the occupied spaces need to be effectively used to facilitate meaningful interactions and create a positive, sustainable work culture. This work aims to determine when spontaneous, collaborative interactions occur within the building and the environmental factors that facilitate such interactions. This study uses smartwatch-based micro-surveys using the Cozie platform to identify the occurrence of and spatially place interactions while categorizing them as a collaboration or distraction. This method uniquely circumvents pitfalls associated with surveying and qualitative data collection: occupant behaviors are identified in real-time in a non-intrusive manner, and survey data is corroborated with quantitative sensor data. A proof-of-concept study was deployed with nine hybrid-working participants providing 100 micro-survey cluster responses over approximately two weeks. The results show the spontaneous interactions occurring in hybrid mode are split evenly among the categories of collaboration, wanted socialization, and distraction and primarily occur with coworkers at one’s desk. From these data, we can establish various correlations between the occurrence of positive spontaneous interactions and different factors, such as the time of day and the locations in the building. This framework and first deployment provide the foundation for future large-scale data collection experiments and human interaction modeling.}},

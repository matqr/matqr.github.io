  abstract = {Thermal comfort assessment for the built environment has become more available to analysts and researchers due to the proliferation of sensors and subjective feedback methods. These data can be used for modeling comfort behavior to support design and operations towards energy efficiency and well-being. By nature, occupant subjective feedback is imbalanced as indoor conditions are designed for comfort, and responses indicating otherwise are less common. This situation creates a scenario for the machine learning workflow where class balancing as a pre-processing step might be valuable for developing predictive thermal comfort classification models with high-performance. This paper investigates the various thermal comfort dataset class balancing techniques from the literature and proposes a modified conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), \$\textbackslash texttt\{comfortGAN\}\$, to address this imbalance scenario. These approaches are applied to three publicly available datasets, ranging from 30 and 67 participants to a global collection of thermal comfort datasets, with 1,474; 2,067; and 66,397 data points, respectively. This work finds that a classification model trained on a balanced dataset, comprised of real and generated samples from \$\textbackslash texttt\{comfortGAN\}\$, has higher performance (increase between 4\% and 17\% in classification accuracy) than other augmentation methods tested. However, when classes representing discomfort are merged and reduced to three, better imbalanced performance is expected, and the additional increase in performance by \$\textbackslash texttt\{comfortGAN\}\$ shrinks to 1-2\%. These results illustrate that class balancing for thermal comfort modeling is beneficial using advanced techniques such as GANs, but its value is diminished in certain scenarios. A discussion is provided to assist potential users in determining which scenarios this process is useful and which method works best.},

  abstract = {The intersection of buildings control and thermal comfort modeling may seem obvious, but there are still prevalent challenges in combining them. ``Occupant centric'' control strategies are mainly trained using building data but rarely leverage occupants' feedback. While thermal comfort models are developed using occupants' data but are seldom integrated into building controls. To bridge this gap, we developed an open-source simulation tool named ComfortLearn. ComfortLearn is an OpenAI Gym-based environment that leverages historical building management system data from real buildings and existing longitudinal thermal comfort datasets for occupant-centric control strategies and benchmarking. We used an evaluation metric named `exceedance' to evaluate occupants' thermal comfort and provide a more realistic picture than traditional evaluations like comfort bands. This setup allows the analysis of different building control strategies and their effect on real occupants, based on empirical data, without the need for computationally expensive co-simulations. A theoretical case study implementation shows that an as-is schedule-based controller complies with its comfort band more than 93\% of the time, but the simulated occupants are comfortable for only 25\% of the occupied time.},

  abstract = {Thermal comfort affects the well-being, productivity, and overall satisfaction of building occupants. However, due to economical and practical limitations, the number of longitudinal studies that have been conducted is limited, and only a few of these studies have shared their data publicly. Longitudinal datasets collected indoors are a valuable resource to better understand how people perceive their environment. Moreover, they provide a more realistic scenario to those conducted in thermal chambers. Our objective was to share publicly a longitudinal dataset comprising data collected over a 4-week long experiment. A total of 17 participants completed thermal preferences surveys which accounted for a total of approximately 1400 unique responses across indoor and outdoor 17 spaces. For the whole duration of the study, we monitored environmental variables (e.g., temperature and relative humidity) throughout 3 buildings. Participants completed comfort surveys from the screen of their smartwatches using an open-source application named Cozie. Their indoor location was continuously monitored using a custom-designed smartphone application. Location data were used to time and spatially align environmental measurements to thermal preference responses provided by the participants. Background information of participants, such as physical characteristics and personality traits (satisfaction with life scale, highly sensitive person scale, the Big Five personality traits), was collected using an on-boarding survey administered at the beginning of the experiment. The dataset is available at https://zenodo.org/record/5502441\#.YT7xyaARUTs.},

  abstract = {Building occupants are complex in the aspects of the indoor environment that satisfies them. Thermal comfort-driven systems control, office floor plan design, and lighting or acoustics considerations are all driven by conventional understandings of how occupants use spaces. Building operators rely on the use of smart system control, however, these approaches ignore the ability of occupants to make decisions for themselves that influence their comfort, satisfaction, and productivity. The future-of-work paradigm shift will introduce more flexibility and behavior-driven opportunities for occupants. The emerging just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) concept is gaining momentum in fields such as mobile health as a means of influencing behavior. This paper outlines a novel methodology using smartwatch-based JITAI combined with micro-ecological momentary assessments (EMA) for field-based data collection and occupant behavior interventions in field-based scenarios. A proof-of-concept deployment of a single user of the methodology is illustrated in order to set the stage for future data collection. This framework can provide the foundation for techniques to enhance the future-ofwork through behavioral interventions in the built environment.},

Unlike other camera-based solutions, FORK is much less privacy invasive (even if the sensor is compromised) and it does not require a powerful machine like a Microsoft XBOX or an Intel \textregistered{} Core TM i7 processor to process the depth data. Our system performs the entire depth data processing on a cheaper and lower-power ARM processor, in real-time. In order to do that, FORK uses a novel light-weight human model by leveraging anthropometric properties of human bodies for detecting individuals. We will show how FORK detects, tracks, and counts occupants accurately in real-time.},

  abstract = {Global climate is changing as a result of anthropogenic warming, leading to higher daily excursions of temperature in cities. Such elevated temperatures have great implications on human thermal comfort and heat stress, which should be closely monitored. Current methods for heat exposure assessments (surveys, microclimate measurements, and laboratory experiments), however, present several limitations: measurements are scattered in time and space and data gathered on outdoor thermal stress and comfort often does not include physiological and behavioral parameters. To address these shortcomings, Project Coolbit aims to introduce a human-centric approach to thermal comfort assessments. In this study, we propose and evaluate the use of wrist-mounted wearable devices to monitor environmental and physiological responses that span a wide range of spatial and temporal distributions. We introduce an integrated wearable weather station that records (a) microclimate parameters (such as air temperature and humidity), (b) physiological parameters (heart rate, skin temperature and humidity), and (c) subjective feedback. The feasibility of this methodology to assess thermal comfort and heat stress is then evaluated using two sets of experiments: controlled-environment physiological data collection, and outdoor environmental data collection. We find that using the data obtained through the wrist-mounted wearables, core temperature can be predicted non-invasively with 95 percent of target attainment within {$\pm$}0.27 {$\smwhtcircle$}C. Additionally, a direct connection between the air temperature at the wrist (Ta,w) and the perceived activity level (PAV) of individuals was drawn. We observe that with increased Ta,w, the desire for physical activity is significantly reduced, reaching `Transition only' PAV level at 36 {$\smwhtcircle$}C. These assessments reveal that the wearable methodology provides a comprehensive and accurate representation of human heat exposure, which can be extended in real-time to cover a large spatial distribution in a given city and quantify the impact of heat exposure on human life.},

Research has explored advanced modelling and sensing techniques for prediction models in order to define better temperature set-points but such prediction remains a fundamental challenge due to the individual preferences of occupants. In this current work I systematically explored data requirements for thermal preference modeling and prediction by generating synthethic data and by leveraging occupants similarities. The results show that augmenting existing datasets provides around 4\% improvements in prediction models and grouping users based on pre-calculated similarities allows an average increase of 5\% for half the occupants in prediction with less historical data (or sometimes none). As next steps, my research aims at combining these new modeling approaches with occupant-centric control for a complete human-in-the-loop control framework.},

Each group has various transition time from arriving at and leaving from their comfort state. On average people who are more sensitive to cold temperatures, Group 1, take 8.9 minutes from being uncomfortably cold and 25.0 minutes from being uncomfortably hot to reach comfort zones. On the other hand, people who are generally comfortable, Group 2, take 22.4 minutes from uncomfortably cold and 27.1 minutes from uncomfortably hot to be thermally comfortable. The average transition time within a cluster matches the thermal comfort trend of said cluster.

A camera-enabled drone was used for acquiring pictures to obtain a high-resolution photogrammetric model. Subsequently, a 3D survey of the monument was conducted with a time-of-flight laser scanner. Contour elevation lines where extracted from TLS, Photogrammetry and Total Station models at the same depths in order to determine the precision of photogrammetry and laser scanner reconstructions. In addition, geometrical comparisons were performed among the 3D models above mentioned and the Kinect sensor. The comparison showed that TLS is the most accurate tool for 3D reconstruction.

Unfortunately, real-world applications are still restricted by the high implementation cost and the unguaranteed profitability. In the traditional paradigm of ``model-centric'' MPC, most effort is devoted to constructing the control-oriented model given specific building properties and data availability. Due to the significant heterogeneity among buildings, the results are hardly reproducible, and a high level of customization is required for each new building. To address this issue, we propose a new ``data-centric'' approach for MPC, which starts with control-oriented data curation that acquires the necessary and cost-effective data concerning the intended control purpose and the building characteristics. The foundation of data-centric MPC is a standardized framework to quantify the data requirements and the established relationships between data usage and control performance. Such an end-to-end framework promotes actual MPC applications with controllable costs and reliable outcomes. We use tropical office buildings as an example to consolidate the data-centric MPC framework. Two use cases are provided to demonstrate its benefits. Over 10\% of energy saving was achieved without excessive occupant-related data, and occupant-centric control significantly improved the thermal comfort only with proper data acquisition.},

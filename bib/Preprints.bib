abstract = {{Building energy prediction and management has become increasingly important in recent decades, driven by the growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the availability of more energy data. However, energy data is often collected from multiple sources and can be incomplete or inconsistent, which can hinder accurate predictions and management of energy systems and limit the usefulness of the data for decision-making and research. To address this issue, past studies have focused on imputing missing gaps in energy data, including random and continuous gaps. One of the main challenges in this area is the lack of validation on a benchmark dataset with various building and meter types, making it difficult to accurately evaluate the performance of different imputation methods. Another challenge is the lack of application of state-of-the-art imputation methods for missing gaps in energy data. Contemporary image-inpainting methods, such as Partial Convolution (PConv), have been widely used in the computer vision domain and have demonstrated their effectiveness in dealing with complex missing patterns. To study whether energy data imputation can benefit from the image-based deep learning method, this study compared PConv, Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and weekly persistence method using one of the biggest publicly available whole building energy datasets, consisting of 1479 power meters worldwide, as the benchmark. The results show that, compared to the CNN with the raw time series (1D-CNN) and the weekly persistence method, neural network models with reshaped energy data with two dimensions reduced the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 10\% to 30\%. The advanced deep learning method, Partial convolution (PConv), has further reduced the MSE by 20-30\% than 2D-CNN and stands out among all models.}},

abstract = {{Hybrid working strategies have become, and will continue to be, the norm for many offices. This raises two considerations: newly unoccupied spaces needlessly consume energy, and the occupied spaces need to be effectively used to facilitate meaningful interactions and create a positive, sustainable work culture. This work aims to determine when spontaneous, collaborative interactions occur within the building and the environmental factors that facilitate such interactions. This study uses smartwatch-based micro-surveys using the Cozie platform to identify the occurrence of and spatially place interactions while categorizing them as a collaboration or distraction. This method uniquely circumvents pitfalls associated with surveying and qualitative data collection: occupant behaviors are identified in real-time in a non-intrusive manner, and survey data is corroborated with quantitative sensor data. A proof-of-concept study was deployed with nine hybrid-working participants providing 100 micro-survey cluster responses over approximately two weeks. The results show the spontaneous interactions occurring in hybrid mode are split evenly among the categories of collaboration, wanted socialization, and distraction and primarily occur with coworkers at one's desk. From these data, we can establish various correlations between the occurrence of positive spontaneous interactions and different factors, such as the time of day and the locations in the building. This framework and first deployment provide the foundation for future large-scale data collection experiments and human interaction modeling.}},

abstract = {{The building sector plays a crucial role in the worldwide decarbonization effort, accounting for significant portions of energy consumption and environmental effects. However, the scarcity of open data sources is a continuous challenge for built environment researchers and practitioners. Although several efforts have been made to consolidate existing open datasets, no database currently offers a comprehensive collection of building data types with all subcategories and time granularities (e.g., year, month, and sub-hour). This paper presents the Building Data Genome Directory, an open data-sharing platform serving as a one-stop shop for the data necessary for vital categories of building energy research. The data directory is an online portal (http://buildingdatadirectory.org/) that allows filtering and discovering valuable datasets. The directory covers meter, building-level, and aggregated community-level data at the spatial scale and year-to-minute level at the temporal scale. The datasets were consolidated from a comprehensive exploration of sources, including governments, research institutes, and online energy dashboards. The results of this effort include the aggregation of 60 datasets pertaining to building energy ontologies, building energy models, building energy and water data, electric vehicle data, weather data, building information data, text-mining-based research data, image data of buildings, fault detection diagnosis data and occupant data. A crowdsourcing mechanism in the platform allows users to submit datasets they suggest for inclusion by filling out an online form. This directory can fuel research and applications on building energy efficiency, which is an essential step toward addressing the world's energy and environmental challenges.}},

abstract = {{We introduce Cohort Comfort Models, a new framework for predicting how new occupants would perceive their thermal environment. Cohort Comfort Models leverage historical data collected from a sample population, who have some underlying preference similarity, to predict thermal preference responses of new occupants. Our framework is capable of exploiting available background information such as physical characteristics and one-time on-boarding surveys (satisfaction with life scale, highly sensitive person scale, the Big Five personality traits) from the new occupant as well as physiological and environmental sensor measurements paired with thermal preference responses. We implemented our framework in two publicly available datasets containing longitudinal data from 55 people, comprising more than 6,000 individual thermal comfort surveys. We observed that, a Cohort Comfort Model that uses background information provided very little change in thermal preference prediction performance but uses none historical data. On the other hand, for half and one third of each dataset occupant population, using Cohort Comfort Models, with less historical data from target occupants, Cohort Comfort Models increased their thermal preference prediction by 8 \% and 5 \% on average, and up to 36 \% and 46 \% for some occupants, when compared to general-purpose models trained on the whole population of occupants. The framework is presented in a data and site agnostic manner, with its diï¬€erent components easily tailored to the data availability of the occupants and the buildings. Cohort Comfort Models can be an important step towards personalization without the need of developing a personalized model for each new occupant.}},

abstract = {{Thermal comfort assessment for the built environment has become more available to analysts and researchers due to the proliferation of sensors and subjective feedback methods. These data can be used for modeling comfort behavior to support design and operations towards energy efficiency and well-being. By nature, occupant subjective feedback is imbalanced as indoor conditions are designed for comfort, and responses indicating otherwise are less common. This situation creates a scenario for the machine learning workflow where class balancing as a pre-processing step might be valuable for developing predictive thermal comfort classification models with high-performance. This paper investigates the various thermal comfort dataset class balancing techniques from the literature and proposes a modified conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), \$\textbackslashtexttt\{comfortGAN\}\$, to address this imbalance scenario. These approaches are applied to three publicly available datasets, ranging from 30 and 67 participants to a global collection of thermal comfort datasets, with 1,474; 2,067; and 66,397 data points, respectively. This work finds that a classification model trained on a balanced dataset, comprised of real and generated samples from \$\textbackslashtexttt\{comfortGAN\}\$, has higher performance (increase between 4\% and 17\% in classification accuracy) than other augmentation methods tested. However, when classes representing discomfort are merged and reduced to three, better imbalanced performance is expected, and the additional increase in performance by \$\textbackslashtexttt\{comfortGAN\}\$ shrinks to 1-2\%. These results illustrate that class balancing for thermal comfort modeling is beneficial using advanced techniques such as GANs, but its value is diminished in certain scenarios. A discussion is provided to assist potential users in determining which scenarios this process is useful and which method works best.}},

abstract = {{Missing data are frequently observed by practitioners and researchers in the building energy modeling community. In this regard, advanced data-driven solutions, such as Deep Learning methods, are typically required to reflect the non-linear behavior of these anomalies. As an ongoing research question related to Deep Learning, a model's applicability to limited data settings can be explored by introducing prior knowledge in the network. This same strategy can also lead to more interpretable predictions, hence facilitating the field application of the approach. For that purpose, the aim of this paper is to propose the use of Physics-informed Denoising Autoencoders (PI-DAE) for missing data imputation in commercial buildings. In particular, the presented method enforces physics-inspired soft constraints to the loss function of a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE). In order to quantify the benefits of the physical component, an ablation study between different DAE configurations is conducted. First, three univariate DAEs are optimized separately on indoor air temperature, heating, and cooling data. Then, two multivariate DAEs are derived from the previous configurations. Eventually, a building thermal balance equation is coupled to the last multivariate configuration to obtain PI-DAE. Additionally, two commonly used benchmarks are employed to support the findings. It is shown how introducing physical knowledge in a multivariate Denoising Autoencoder can enhance the inherent model interpretability through the optimized physics-based coefficients. While no significant improvement is observed in terms of reconstruction error with the proposed PI-DAE, its enhanced robustness to varying rates of missing data and the valuable insights derived from the physics-based coefficients create opportunities for wider applications within building systems and the built environment.}},

eprint = {2404.00525},
abstract = {{Advances in machine learning and increased computational power have driven progress in energy-related research. However, limited access to private energy data from buildings hinders traditional regression models relying on historical data. While generative models offer a solution, previous studies have primarily focused on short-term generation periods (e.g., daily profiles) and a limited number of meters. Thus, the study proposes a conditional diffusion model for generating high-quality synthetic energy data using relevant metadata. Using a dataset comprising 1,828 power meters from various buildings and countries, this model is compared with traditional methods like Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) and Conditional Variational Auto-Encoders (CVAE). It explicitly handles long-term annual consumption profiles, harnessing metadata such as location, weather, building, and meter type to produce coherent synthetic data that closely resembles real-world energy consumption patterns. The results demonstrate the proposed diffusion model's superior performance, with a 36\% reduction in Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score and a 13\% decrease in Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL divergence) compared to the following best method. The proposed method successfully generates high-quality energy data through metadata, and its code will be open-sourced, establishing a foundation for a broader array of energy data generation models in the future.}},

abstract = {{Street view imagery (SVI) has been instrumental in many studies in the past decade to understand and characterize street features and the built environment. Researchers across a variety of domains, such as transportation, health, architecture, human perception, and infrastructure have employed different methods to analyze SVI. However, these applications and image-processing procedures have not been standardized, and solutions have been implemented in isolation, often making it difficult for others to reproduce existing work and carry out new research. Using SVI for research requires multiple technical steps: accessing APIs for scalable data collection, preprocessing images to standardize formats, implementing computer vision models for feature extraction, and conducting spatial analysis. These technical requirements create barriers for researchers in urban studies, particularly those without extensive programming experience. We develop ZenSVI, a free and open-source Python package that integrates and implements the entire process of SVI analysis, supporting a wide range of use cases. Its end-to-end pipeline includes downloading SVI from multiple platforms (e.g., Mapillary and KartaView) efficiently, analyzing metadata of SVI, applying computer vision models to extract target features, transforming SVI into different projections (e.g., fish-eye and perspective) and different formats (e.g., depth map and point cloud), visualizing analyses with maps and plots, and exporting outputs to other software tools. We demonstrate its use in Singapore through a case study of data quality assessment and clustering analysis in a streamlined manner. Our software improves the transparency, reproducibility, and scalability of research relying on SVI and supports researchers in conducting urban analyses efficiently. Its modular design facilitates extensions and unlocking new use cases.}},

  abstract = {Understanding people's preferences and needs is crucial for urban planning decisions, yet current approaches often combine them from multi-cultural and multi-city populations, obscuring important demographic differences and risking amplifying biases. We conducted a large-scale urban visual perception survey of streetscapes worldwide using street view imagery, examining how demographics -- including gender, age, income, education, race and ethnicity, and, for the first time, personality traits -- shape perceptions among 1,000 participants, with balanced demographics, from five countries and 45 nationalities. This dataset, introduced as Street Perception Evaluation Considering Socioeconomics (SPECS), exhibits statistically significant differences in perception scores in six traditionally used indicators (safe, lively, wealthy, beautiful, boring, and depressing) and four new ones we propose (live nearby, walk, cycle, green) among demographics and personalities. We revealed that location-based sentiments are carried over in people's preferences when comparing urban streetscapes with other cities. Further, we compared the perception scores based on where participants and streetscapes are from. We found that an off-the-shelf machine learning model trained on an existing global perception dataset tends to overestimate positive indicators and underestimate negative ones compared to human responses, suggesting that targeted intervention should consider locals' perception. Our study aspires to rectify the myopic treatment of street perception, which rarely considers demographics or personality traits.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a low-cost AC meter designed to continu-ously measure voltage and current waveforms at up to 14 kHz. The AC power meter, provided as open hardware, is designed using the same micro controller as the Arduino UNO 1 with an In-system Programming (ISP) interface, thus allowing the user to change the firmware to match their particular use case using Arduino libraries or standard C language. The suggested design is compatible with the Raspberry Pi 3 2 , making it a suitable real-time measurement accessory for the single board computer. The platform features an 8 channel simultaneous sampling Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) which allows a high fidelity sampling without time offsets. Depend-ing on how the user decides to combine current transformers (CTs) and AC-AC voltage adapters for the input channels, circuit breakers or appliances can be measured in either one phase or three phases.},

abstract = {Total Station has been one of the most common acquisition devices for achieving maps through topographic survey. Nowadays, Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) and Photogrammetry are commonly used to generate accurate meshes. In addition, commercial products such as Kinect offer low cost technology to acquire point-cloud information. The present paper aims to measure the accuracy of these digital modelling techniques by employing elevation contour maps, surface deviations and distance measurements. For this purpose, a 450 m sector of the Qhapaq Nan located in Lima-Peru, was selected as a case of study. A camera-enabled drone was used for acquiring pictures to obtain a high-resolution photogrammetric model. Subsequently, a 3D survey of the monument was conducted with a time-of-flight laser scanner. Contour elevation lines where extracted from TLS, Photogrammetry and Total Station models at the same depths in order to determine the precision of photogrammetry and laser scanner reconstructions. In addition, geometrical comparisons were performed among the 3D models above mentioned and the Kinect sensor. The comparison showed that TLS is the most accurate tool for 3D reconstruction. However, Photogrammetry and Kinect provided errors of less than one centimeter in accuracy.},

abstract = {Many energy performance analysis methodologies assign buildings a descriptive label that represents their main activity, often known as the primary space usage (PSU). This attribute comes from the intent of the design team based on assumptions of how the majority of the spaces in the building will be used. In reality, the way a building's occupants actually use the spaces can be different than what was intended. With the recent growth of hourly electricity meter data from the built environment, there is the opportunity to create unsupervised methods to analyze electricity consumption behavior to understand whether the PSU assigned is accurate. Misclassification or oversimplification of the use of the building is possible using these labels when applied to simulation inputs or benchmarking processes. To work towards accurate characterization of a building's utilization, we propose a modular methodology for identifying potentially mislabeled buildings using distance-based clustering analysis based on hourly electricity consumption data. This method seeks to segment buildings according to their daily behavior and predict which ones are misfits according to their assigned PSU label. The process assigns a flag indicating potential mixed-use or a misclassified PSU label based on uncharacteristic electricity use behavior. Our results on two public data sets, from the Building Data Genome (BDG) Project and Washington DC (DGS), with 507 and 322 buildings respectively, show that 26{\%} and 33{\%} of these buildings are potentially mislabelled based on their load shape behavior. Such information provides a more realistic insight into their true consumption characteristics, enabling more accurate simulation scenarios. Applications of this process and a discussion of limitations and reproducibility are included.},

In this demonstration, we present a novel solution called FORK, which uses a Kinect depth sensor for estimating occupancy in real-time. Unlike other camera-based solutions, FORK is much less privacy invasive (even if the sensor is compromised) and it does not require a powerful machine like a Microsoft XBOX or an Intel {\textregistered} Core TM i7 processor to process the depth data. Our system performs the entire depth data processing on a cheaper and lower-power ARM processor, in real-time. In order to do that, FORK uses a novel light-weight human model by leveraging anthropometric properties of human bodies for detecting individuals. We will show how FORK detects, tracks, and counts occupants accurately in real-time.},

abstract = {Thermal comfort assessment for the built environment has become more available to analysts and researchers due to the proliferation of sensors and subjective feedback methods. These data can be used for modeling comfort behavior to support design and operations towards energy efficiency and well-being. By nature, occupant subjective feedback is imbalanced as indoor conditions are designed for comfort, and responses indicating otherwise are less common. This situation creates a scenario for the machine learning workflow where class balancing as a pre-processing step might be valuable for developing predictive thermal comfort classification models with high-performance. This paper investigates the various thermal comfort dataset class balancing techniques from the literature and proposes a modified conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), {\$}\backslashtexttt{\{}comfortGAN{\}}{\$}, to address this imbalance scenario. These approaches are applied to three publicly available datasets, ranging from 30 and 67 participants to a global collection of thermal comfort datasets, with 1,474; 2,067; and 66,397 data points, respectively. This work finds that a classification model trained on a balanced dataset, comprised of real and generated samples from {\$}\backslashtexttt{\{}comfortGAN{\}}{\$}, has higher performance (increase between 4{\%} and 17{\%} in classification accuracy) than other augmentation methods tested. However, when classes representing discomfort are merged and reduced to three, better imbalanced performance is expected, and the additional increase in performance by {\$}\backslashtexttt{\{}comfortGAN{\}}{\$} shrinks to 1-2{\%}. These results illustrate that class balancing for thermal comfort modeling is beneficial using advanced techniques such as GANs, but its value is diminished in certain scenarios.

abstract = {This study describes a human-building interaction framework called the SDE Learning Trail, a mobile app that is currently deployed at the SDE4 building-the new Net Zero Energy Building (NZEB) at the National University of Singapore (NUS). This framework enables building occupants and visitors to learn about the well and green features of the new NZEB while facilitating collection of environmental comfort feedback in a simple and intuitive way. Within just three months, 1163 feedback responses of thermal, visual and aural comfort were obtained. A total of 616 participants have contributed to the study till date, with 79 participants who provided five or more instances of feedback. This data set provides new opportunities for understanding occupant comfort behavior through supervised and unsupervised data-driven methods. This paper demonstrates how occupants can be clustered into comfort personality types that could be used as a foundation for prediction and recommendation systems that use real-time occupant behavior instead of rigid comfort models. We provide an overview of the application methodology and initial results in the SDE4 building.},

abstract = {Evaluating and optimising human comfort within the built environment is challenging due to the large number of physiological, psychological and environmental variables that affect occupant comfort preference. Humans are often better than sensors at capturing all of these disparate phenomena and interpreting their impact; the challenge is collecting spatially and temporally diverse subjective feedback in a scalable way. This paper presents a methodology to collect intensive longitudinal subjective feedback of comfort-based preference using micro ecological momentary assessments on a smartwatch platform. An experiment with 30 occupants over two weeks produced 4,378 field-based surveys for thermal, noise, and acoustic preference. The occupants and the spaces in which they left feedback were then clustered according to these preference tendencies. These groups were used to create different feature sets with combinations of environmental and physiological variables, for use in a multi-class classification task. These classification models were trained on a feature set that was developed from time-series attributes, environmental and near-body sensors, heart rate, and the historical preferences of both the individual and the comfort group assigned. The most accurate model didn't use environmental sensor data and yet had multi-class classification F1 micro scores of 64{\%}, 80{\%} and 86{\%} for thermal, light, and noise preference, respectively. The discussion outlines how these models provide comfort preference prediction as good or better than installed sensors, even in situations when some occupants are not willing or able to wear smartwatches. The approach presented prompts reflection on how the building analysis community evaluates, controls, and designs indoor environments.},

abstract = {One important goal of the built environment is to provide thermal comfort, since it affects occupant satisfaction, health, and performance. Existing approaches make use of pre-defined rules with pre-defined set-points, i.e., the temperature set-points in an indoor environment, which in turn contributes to one third of the total energy consumption of buildings. Research has explored advanced modelling and sensing techniques for prediction models in order to define better temperature set-points but such prediction remains a fundamental challenge due to the individual preferences of occupants. In this current work I systematically explored data requirements for thermal preference modeling and prediction by generating synthethic data and by leveraging occupants similarities. The results show that augmenting existing datasets provides around 4{\%} improvements in prediction models and grouping users based on pre-calculated similarities allows an average increase of 5{\%} for half the occupants in prediction with less historical data (or sometimes none). As next steps, my research aims at combining these new modeling approaches with occupant-centric control for a complete human-in-the-loop control framework.},

abstract = {Thermal comfort affects the well-being, productivity, and overall satisfaction of building occupants. However, due to economical and practical limitations, the number of longitudinal studies that have been conducted is limited, and only a few of these studies have shared their data publicly. Longitudinal datasets collected indoors are a valuable resource to better understand how people perceive their environment. Moreover, they provide a more realistic scenario to those conducted in thermal chambers. Our objective was to share publicly a longitudinal dataset comprising data collected over a 4-week long experiment. A total of 17 participants completed thermal preferences surveys which accounted for a total of approximately 1400 unique responses across indoor and outdoor 17 spaces. For the whole duration of the study, we monitored environmental variables (e.g., temperature and relative humidity) throughout 3 buildings. Participants completed comfort surveys from the screen of their smartwatches using an open-source application named Cozie. Their indoor location was continuously monitored using a custom-designed smartphone application. Location data were used to time and spatially align environmental measurements to thermal preference responses provided by the participants. Background information of participants, such as physical characteristics and personality traits (satisfaction with life scale, highly sensitive person scale, the Big Five personality traits), was collected using an on-boarding survey administered at the beginning of the experiment.

Each group has various transition time from arriving at and leaving from their comfort state. On average people who are more sensitive to cold temperatures, Group 1, take 8.9 minutes from being uncomfortably cold and 25.0 minutes from being uncomfortably hot to reach comfort zones. On the other hand, people who are generally comfortable, Group 2, take 22.4 minutes from uncomfortably cold and 27.1 minutes from uncomfortably hot to be thermally comfortable. The average transition time within a cluster matches the thermal comfort trend of said cluster. Ultimately, the transient time of preference groups raises the possibility to improve individualized thermal comfort models and machine learning in the future.},

However, despite the benefits that this method holds, price and portability continue to be an issue for its application in low-income countries. This work presents a characterization (error measurement and working conditions) of the Microsoft Kinect sensor and a complete methodology of data acquisition, registration and 3D reconstruction of archaeological walls based on the application of computer vision algorithms and image processing. Consecutive range and color images are obtained by a Kinect for XBOX 360. Then, the range images are converted into point clouds and separated in groups. Based on their respective color images, they are aligned using the Speeded Up Robust Features algorithm and refined with an Iterative Closest Point approach. Finally, an accumulative registration using ICP approach is applied to all point clouds in a combinatory fashion. Subsequently, a 3D mesh is formed and compared with other 3D reconstructions based on photogrammetry and 3D laser scanners. Experiments show errors of 6.3 millimeters in accuracy and 2.2 millimeters in precision. Accuracy errors of 4.79 and 1.49 centimeters are obtained when compared to a photogrammetry-based reconstruction and a laser scanner model, respectively. This methodology provides relatively high accuracy metrics and proposes an inexpensive alternative for 3D scanning that surpasses other devices in terms of price and time needed for data acquisition.},

	abstract = {Many energy performance analysis methodologies assign buildings a descriptive label that represents their main activity, often known as the primary space usage (PSU). This attribute comes from the intent of the design team based on assumptions of how the majority of the spaces in the building will be used. In reality, the way a building’s occupants actually use the spaces can be different than what was intended. With the recent growth of hourly electricity meter data from the built environment, there is the opportunity to create unsupervised methods to analyze electricity consumption behavior to understand whether the PSU assigned is accurate. Misclassification or oversimplification of the use of the building is possible using these labels when applied to simulation inputs or benchmarking processes. To work towards accurate characterization of a building’s utilization, we propose a modular methodology for identifying potentially mislabeled buildings using distance-based clustering analysis based on hourly electricity consumption data. This method seeks to segment buildings according to their daily behavior and predict which ones are misfits according to their assigned PSU label. The process assigns a flag indicating potential mixed-use or a misclassified PSU label based on uncharacteristic electricity use behavior. Our results on two public data sets, from the Building Data Genome (BDG) Project and Washington DC (DGS), with 507 and 322 buildings respectively, show that 26\% and 33\% of these buildings are potentially mislabelled based on their load shape behavior. Such information provides a more realistic insight into their true consumption characteristics, enabling more accurate simulation scenarios. Applications of this process and a discussion of limitations and reproducibility are included.},

	abstract = {Evaluating and optimising human comfort within the built environment is challenging due to the large number of physiological, psychological and environmental variables that affect occupant comfort preference. Humans are often better than sensors at capturing all of these disparate phenomena and interpreting their impact; the challenge is collecting spatially and temporally diverse subjective feedback in a scalable way. This paper presents a methodology to collect intensive longitudinal subjective feedback of comfort-based preference using micro ecological momentary assessments on a smartwatch platform. An experiment with 30 occupants over two weeks produced 4,378 field-based surveys for thermal, noise, and acoustic preference. The occupants and the spaces in which they left feedback were then clustered according to these preference tendencies. These groups were used to create different feature sets with combinations of environmental and physiological variables, for use in a multi-class classification task. These classification models were trained on a feature set that was developed from time-series attributes, environmental and near-body sensors, heart rate, and the historical preferences of both the individual and the comfort group assigned. The most accurate model didn't use environmental sensor data and yet had multi-class classification F1 micro scores of 64\%, 80\% and 86\% for thermal, light, and noise preference, respectively. The discussion outlines how these models provide comfort preference prediction as good or better than installed sensors, even in situations when some occupants are not willing or able to wear smartwatches. The approach presented prompts reflection on how the building analysis community evaluates, controls, and designs indoor environments.},

The ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III (GEPIII) machine learning competition used an extensive meter data set to crowdsource the most accurate machine learning workflow for whole building energy prediction. A significant component of the winning solutions was the pre-processing phase to remove anomalous training data. Contemporary pre-processing methods focus on filtering statistical threshold values or deep learning methods requiring training data and multiple hyper-parameters. A recent method named ALDI (Automated Load profile Discord Identification) managed to identify these discords using matrix profile, but the technique still requires user-defined parameters. We develop ALDI++, a method based on the previous work that bypasses user-defined parameters and takes advantage of discord similarity. We evaluate ALDI++ against a statistical threshold, variational auto-encoder, and the original ALDI as baselines in classifying discords and energy forecasting scenarios. Our results demonstrate that while the classification performance improvement over the original method is marginal, ALDI++ helps achieve the best forecasting error improving 6\% over the winning's team approach with six times less computation time.},

This approach leverages historical data collected from a sample population, who have some underlying preference similarity to the new occupant. The method uses background information such as physical and demographic characteristics and one-time onboarding surveys (satisfaction with life scale, highly sensitive person scale, personality traits) from the new occupant, as well as physiological and environmental sensor measurements paired with a few thermal preference responses. The framework was implemented using two personal comfort datasets containing longitudinal data from 55 people. The datasets comprise more than 6000 unique righthere-right-now thermal comfort surveys. The results show that a CCM that uses only the one-time onboarding survey information of an individual occupant has generally as good or better performance as compared to conventional general-purpose models, but uses no historical longitudinal data as compared to personalized models. If up to ten historical personal preference data points are used, CCM increased the thermal preference prediction by 8\% on average and up to 36\% for half of the occupants in the first of the tested datasets. In the second dataset, one-third of the occupants increased their thermal preference prediction by 5\% on average and up to 46\%. CCM can be an important step toward the development of personalized thermal comfort models without the need to collect a large number of datapoints per person.},

abstract = {{Building energy prediction and management has become increasingly important in recent decades, driven by the growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the availability of more energy data. However, energy data is often collected from multiple sources and can be incomplete or inconsistent, which can hinder accurate predictions and management of energy systems and limit the usefulness of the data for decision-making and research. To address this issue, past studies have focused on imputing missing gaps in energy data, including random and continuous gaps. One of the main challenges in this area is the lack of validation on a benchmark dataset with various building and meter types, making it difficult to accurately evaluate the performance of different imputation methods. Another challenge is the lack of application of state-of-the-art imputation methods for missing gaps in energy data. Contemporary image-inpainting methods, such as Partial Convolution (PConv), have been widely used in the computer vision domain and have demonstrated their effectiveness in dealing with complex missing patterns. Given that energy data often exhibits regular daily or weekly patterns, such methods could be leveraged to exploit the regularity of the data to learn underlying patterns and generate more accurate predictions for missing values. To study whether energy data imputation can benefit from the image-based deep learning method, this study compared PConv, Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and weekly persistence method using one of the biggest publicly available whole building energy datasets, consisting of 1479 power meters worldwide, as the benchmark. The results show that, compared to the CNN with the raw time series (1D-CNN) and the weekly persistence method, neural network models with reshaped energy data with two dimensions reduced the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 10\% to 30\%. The advanced deep learning method, Partial convolution (PConv), has further reduced the MSE by 20\%–30\% than 2D-CNN and stands out among all models. Based on these results, this study demonstrates the potential applicability of time-series imaging in imputing energy data. The proposed imputation model has also been tested on a benchmark dataset with a range of meter types and sources, demonstrating its generalizability to include additional accessible energy datasets. This offers a scalable and effective solution for filling in missing energy data in both academic and industrial contexts.}},

abstract = {{Missing data are frequently observed by practitioners and researchers in the building energy modeling community. In this regard, advanced data-driven solutions, such as Deep Learning methods, are typically required to reflect the non-linear behavior of these anomalies. As an ongoing research question related to Deep Learning, a model's applicability to limited data settings can be explored by introducing prior knowledge in the network. This same strategy can also lead to more interpretable predictions, hence facilitating the field application of the approach. For that purpose, the aim of this paper is to propose the use of Physics-informed Denoising Autoencoders (PI-DAE) for missing data imputation in commercial buildings. In particular, the presented method enforces physics-inspired soft constraints to the loss function of a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE). In order to quantify the benefits of the physical component, an ablation study between different DAE configurations is conducted. First, three univariate DAEs are optimized separately on indoor air temperature, heating, and cooling data. Then, two multivariate DAEs are derived from the previous configurations. Eventually, a building thermal balance equation is coupled to the last multivariate configuration to obtain PI-DAE. Additionally, two commonly used benchmarks are employed to support the findings. It is shown how introducing physical knowledge in a multivariate Denoising Autoencoder can enhance the inherent model interpretability through the optimized physics-based coefficients. While no significant improvement is observed in terms of reconstruction error with the proposed PI-DAE, its enhanced robustness to varying rates of missing data and the valuable insights derived from the physics-based coefficients create opportunities for wider applications within building systems and the built environment.}},

abstract = {{In a global context of increasing flexibility in the way workplaces and the districts in which they are located are used, there is a need for occupant-driven approaches to plan urban energy systems. Several authors have suggested the use of agent-based models (ABM) of building occupants in urban building energy simulations due to their ability to reproduce emergent behaviors from individual agents’ actions. However, few works in the literature take full advantage of the ABM paradigm, accounting for both occupant presence and energy-relevant behaviors at the district scale. In this work, we propose a methodology to develop a data-driven, agent-based model of building occupants’ activities and thermal comfort in an urban district. Our methodology combines the use of campus-scale Wi-Fi data to derive feasible occupant activity and location plans, along with thermal preference profiles derived from a longitudinal field study where off-the-shelf, non-intrusive sensors were used to capture the right-here-right-now thermal preference of 35 participants in the same case study district. Our model is then used to explore how different district operation strategies could affect building energy performance in the context of increased workspace flexibility. Our results show that by providing a diversity of building operation conditions, with different buildings having different set point temperatures, occupants’ thermal comfort hours could be improved by an average of about 10\% with little effect on district energy performance. Meanwhile, a 6\%–15\% average decrease in space cooling energy use intensity was observed when implementing occupant-driven ventilation and setpoint controls, regardless of location choice scenario.}},

However, limited access to private energy data from buildings hinders traditional regression models relying on historical data. While generative models offer a solution, previous studies have primarily focused on short-term generation periods (e.g., daily profiles) and a limited number of meters. Thus, the study proposes a conditional diffusion model for generating high-quality synthetic energy data using relevant metadata. Using a dataset comprising 1,828 power meters from various buildings and countries, this model is compared with traditional methods like Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) and Conditional Variational Auto-Encoders (CVAE). It explicitly handles long-term annual consumption profiles, harnessing metadata such as location, weather, building, and meter type to produce coherent synthetic data that closely resembles real-world energy consumption patterns. The results demonstrate the proposed diffusion model's superior performance, with a 36\% reduction in Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) score and a 13\% decrease in Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL divergence) compared to the following best method. The proposed method successfully generates high-quality energy data through metadata, and its code will be open-sourced, establishing a foundation for a broader array of energy data generation models in the future.}},

Billions of images worldwide have been made available by commercial services such as Google Street View and crowdsourcing services such as Mapillary and KartaView where anyone from anywhere can upload imagery while moving. However, while the data tend to be plentiful, have high coverage and quality, and are used to derive rich insights, they remain simple and limited in metadata as characteristics such as weather, quality, and lighting conditions remain unknown, making it difficult to evaluate the suitability of the images for specific analyses. We introduce Global Streetscapes — a dataset of 10 million crowdsourced and free-to-use SVIs sampled from 688 cities across 210 countries and territories, enriched with more than 300 camera, geographical, temporal, contextual, semantic, and perceptual attributes. The cities included are well balanced and diverse, and are home to about 10\% of the world’s population. Deep learning models are trained on a subset of manually labelled images for eight visual-contextual attributes pertaining to the usability of SVI — panoramic status, lighting condition, view direction, weather, platform, quality, presence of glare and reflections, achieving accuracy ranging from 68.3\% to 99.9\%, and used to automatically label the entire dataset. Thanks to its scale and pre-computed standard semantic information, the data can be readily used to benefit existing use cases and to unlock new applications, including multi-city comparative studies and longitudinal analyses, as affirmed by a couple of use cases in the paper. Moreover, the automated processes and open-source code facilitate the expansion and updates of the dataset and encourage users to create their own datasets. With the rich manual annotations, some of which are provided for the first time, and diverse conditions present in the images, the dataset also facilitates assessing the heterogeneous properties of crowdsourced SVIs and provides a benchmark for evaluating future computer vision models.

To mitigate such perspective biases, we introduce a novel framework with generative adversarial network (GAN)-based image generation models (Pix2Pix and CycleGAN), an image regression model (ResNet-50), and a tabular model (LightGBM). Experiments assessed model effectiveness in translating car-centric views to those from pedestrian and cyclist perspectives. Results show significant differences in semantic indicators (e.g. green view index) between road center and road shoulder/sidewalk SVI, with low Pearson’s correlation coefficients r (0.35–0.55 for road shoulders and 0.45–0.47 for sidewalks) indicating bias. The framework succeeded in creating realistic images and aligning pixel ratios between perspectives, achieving strong correlation coefficients (0.81 for road shoulders and 0.83 for sidewalks), thus reducing bias. This work contributes by providing a scalable and model-agnostic approach to produce accurate SVIs for urban planning and sustainability, setting a foundation for improving bikeability and walkability assessments and promoting active transportation.}},

With the advancement of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), recommendation systems and reinforcement learning (RL) have emerged as promising approaches to induce behavioral changes to improve the indoor environment and energy efficiency of buildings. This study aims to employ text mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to thoroughly examine the connections among these approaches in the context of human-building interaction and occupant context-aware support. The study analyzed 27,595 articles from the ScienceDirect database, revealing extensive use of recommendation systems and RL for space optimization, location recommendations, and personalized control suggestions. Although these systems are broadly applied to specific content, their use in optimizing indoor environments and energy efficiency remains limited. This gap likely arises from the need for interdisciplinary knowledge and extensive sensor data. Traditional recommendation algorithms, including collaborative filtering, content-based and knowledge-based methods, are commonly employed. However, the more complex challenges of optimizing indoor conditions and energy efficiency often depend on sophisticated machine learning (ML) techniques like reinforcement and deep learning. Furthermore, this review underscores the vast potential for expanding recommender systems and RL applications in buildings and indoor environments. Fields ripe for innovation include predictive maintenance, building-related product recommendation, and optimization of environments tailored for specific needs, such as sleep and productivity enhancements based on user feedback. The study also notes the limitations of the method in capturing subtle academic nuances.

The increased integration of variable energy sources, such as renewables, introduces uncertainties and unprecedented flexibilities, necessitating buildings to adapt their energy demand to enhance grid resiliency. Consequently, buildings must transition from passive energy consumers to active grid assets, providing demand flexibility and energy elasticity while maintaining occupant comfort and health. This fundamental shift demands advanced optimal control methods to manage escalating energy demand and avert power outages. Reinforcement learning (RL) emerges as a promising method to address these challenges. In this paper, we explore ten questions related to the application of RL in buildings, specifically targeting flexible energy management. We consider the growing availability of data, advancements in machine learning algorithms, open-source tools, and the practical deployment aspects associated with software and hardware requirements.

Undergraduate students are awesome! What started as a mandatory requirement for the doctoral degree evolved into an amazing experience of discussing intellectual inquiries and research doubts with students. Subsequently, I guide and mentor them regarding research framing and finding educational resources. Through this mentorship, I've managed to learn more about supervising and management skill for a research project. Often, this mentoring service results in scientific papers, research posters, and help with my own research projects.

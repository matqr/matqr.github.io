Students are awesome! What started as a requirement for the doctoral degree evolved into a fantastic experience of discussing intellectual inquiries and research doubts with undergraduate and postgraduate students. Subsequently, I guide and mentor them regarding research framing and finding educational resources. This mentorship has taught me more about supervising and increased my research project management skills. Often, this mentoring service results in scientific papers, research posters, and/or help with my research projects.

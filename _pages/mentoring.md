Undergraduate students are awesome! What started as a mandatory requirement for the doctoral degree evolved into an amazing experience of discussing intellectual inquiries and research doubts with students. Subsequently, I guide and mentor them regarding research framing and finding educational resources. Through this mentorship, I've managed to learn more about supervising and have increased my research project management skills. Often, this mentoring service results in scientific papers, research posters, and/or help with my own research projects.

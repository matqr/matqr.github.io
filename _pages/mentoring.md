Students are awesome! What started as a requirement for the doctoral degree evolved into a fantastic experience of discussing intellectual inquiries and research doubts with undergraduate and postgraduate students.
Since then, I guide and mentor them regarding research framing, finding educational resources, and preparing for industry career related to machine learning and data science.
Often, this mentoring service results in scientific papers, research posters, and/or help with my research projects.

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [**School of Design and Environment**](http://www.sde.nus.edu.sg/) at the National University of Singapore (NUS) advised by Prof. [**Clayton Miller**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=akL857IAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I am part of the [**Building and Urban Data Science Lab (BUDSLab)**](http://www.budslab.org/) and graduate student researcher for [**Singapore-Berkeley Building Efficiency and Sustainability in the Tropics 2 (SinBerBEST2)**](https://sinberbest.berkeley.edu/)

My research interests are broadly in the field of robotics, remote sensing, applied machine learning, and their applications to smart buildings and occupant thermal comfort. My recent work focuses on deep unsupervised learning, recommender systems, time-series outlier detection, and reinforcement learning with human-in-the-loop control.

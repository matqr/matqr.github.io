I am a [**Postdoctoral Researcher and Module Coordinator**](https://fcl.ethz.ch/people/researchers/matias-quintana.html) in the [**Singapore-ETH Centre (SEC)**](https://sec.ethz.ch/) at the [**Future Cities Lab (FCL) Global**](https://sec.ethz.ch/research/fcl.html) project working with Prof. [**Filip Biljecki**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jGqm4kEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I am also part of Prof. Biljecki's group, the [**Urban Analytics Lab (UAL)**](https://ual.sg/) at the National University of Singapore.

My research interests are broadly in the field of remote sensing, urban data science, GeoAI, time-series forecasting, human-building interaction, applied machine learning, and their applications to smart buildings and at the urban scale.
My recent work focuses on human-perception at the urban scale, agent-based modeling, energy time-series, and reinforcement learning with human-in-the-loop control.

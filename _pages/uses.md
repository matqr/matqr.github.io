## Hardware

## Development
- IDE: NeoVim, VScode, RStudio
- Terminal emulator: [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/index.html)
- Shell: [fish](https://fishshell.com/) with [oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)

I use the terminal and CLI tools for scripting and just general shell surfing.
